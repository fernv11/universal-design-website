# universal-design-website

The purpose of this project was to research and learn about the 
importance of universal design in order to code my own website (https://fernv11.github.io/universal-design-website/index.html), 
where I include this research for educational purposes. I built the website using HTML / CSS, 
and not only is the content about universal design, but I also incorporated the 7 principles of design. 
The website utilizes alt text so it can be used by screen readers to describe the pictures. 
A screen reader can be utilized for the entire website and it was tested with the extension, HTML5 Outliner.  
The colors, font and size of the text were tested using the WAVE evaluation tool and passed.
